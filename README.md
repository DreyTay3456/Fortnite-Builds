In command prompt, install Internet Archive by typing this:

pip install internetarchive

Then double click on an installer bat file to install the version you want.

Note- All the builds I uploaded were only purposed as a back-up, so downloading these are quite slower that sites like Google Drive and Mega. I suggest you use EasyInstaller or download it from notsamicc's Github page instead, unless you want a build that was taken down.
